        <h3>Hey, I am Tanishka. I am from Agra Uttarpradesh. Currently I am persuing B.Tech in Computer Science From IET Agra. I had also learned C and C++ and now learning Java. To tell the truth, I never want to be an Engineer from my childhood I want to join Defence services, a life full of adventures,Diciplane,Buddies,new places,and many other things. And this is my childhood dream.These thing attracts me,But life has its own plans.I believe "JO HOTA H ACCHE KE LIYE HOTA H, SAYAD AGE KUCH OR ISSE JYADA ACCHA HO". so i accept it.And I believe that I will be doing great in future.
